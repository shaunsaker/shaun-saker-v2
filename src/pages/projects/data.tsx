        My wife gave me a DNA test as my Christmas present in 2023. I was so stoked to find out that
        I was 34% Scottish, 28% German and 22% English (there is even 1% Bengal in there, someone
        enjoyed their time in the colony üòâ). Naturally, I had to figure this out all for myself so
        I built a family tree. It turns out my family on my late Father's side is from German
        nobility ü§Ø Kotze was my original surname, which means something rather unfortunate in
        modern German (ü§Æ) but back in the day, it was related to coats üòÖ
        <br />
        <br />
        On my Mom's side, we found Scottish links (as expected) but we also dove deeper into a known
        English link to missionaries that came to South Africa in the 1800s, namely Holloway
        Helmore's family who was later murdered by a tribe in Central Africa. There also happened to
        be links to English royalty, this all made me feel very posh üòÇ
        <br />
        <br />
        This all culminated in a presentation given to my South African family who had come to visit
        in Australia in Christmas of 2023.

        eggplant parmigiana for days!). Even our domestic worker had her own section where she grew
        Covo (a type of spinach from Zimbabwe) and she was so stoked. This was one of my all-time

        little containers and hosued in a custom wooden tray, I figured there should be an app to
