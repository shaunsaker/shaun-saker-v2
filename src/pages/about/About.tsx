        <ParagraphText>
          Growing up in South Africa has played an essential role in shaping who I am today. Being
          born and raised in a culturally diverse and developing country has provided me with a
          unique perspective on life. Through my experiences, I have learned invaluable lessons and
          skills that have contributed significantly to my personal and professional growth,
          including: adaptability, empathy, resourcefulness, resilience, the importance of community
          and an awareness of global issues.

        <ParagraphText>
          I like to have fun and don&apos;t take myself too seriously. When I&apos;m not coding,
          you&apos;ll find me with my kids, camping, playing volleyball, going for a run, concocting
          something new in the kitchen, tinkering with 3D printing, electronics or Dall-e (as
          pictured in the background).

        <ParagraphText>
          I&apos;m currently looking for a remote role on a smallish, async-first team that is doing
          something meaningful. Give me a shout if you think we could work together 🙂
