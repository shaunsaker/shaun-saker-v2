          Hello 👋🏻 My name’s Shaun and I’m a Product Engineer based in Brisbane, Australia 🇦🇺
          <br />
          <br />
          Originally a qualified Geologist, I spent years working with very manual processes that I
          knew I could automate if only I knew how to code. So I enrolled and completed a Python
          course via the University of Michigan, returned to the office, wrote a few scripts and
          fell in love 😍
          <br />
          <br />
          It was then and there that I decided that I wanted to code. I spent the next 6 months
          studying with FreeCodeCamp after hours, until I got my first job as a Web Developer in
          Cape Town 🤓
          <br />
          <br />
          Fast forward almost 8 years later, I’m currently the Lead Frontend Engineer at a startup
          called SAVI Surgical, where we’re leveraging AI and ML in the Med-tech space. I’ve built
          many products along the way and in wide array of industries including the productivity
          space (with my absolute favourite startup called Timeular based in Austria 🇦🇹). During my
          time at AUX Studio in Cape Town, I was lucky enough to do loads of rapid prototyping. I
          was also the Lead Engineer on a mobile project for one of the largest hospital networks in
          South Africa, Mediclinic.
          <br />
          <br />I love to build amazing products that solve actual problems and I like to keep
          things simple, practical and fun 🤩
          <br />
          <br />
          When I’m not coding, I enjoy my daily runs, playing volleyball, being outdoors as much as
          possible, cooking and experimenting in the kitchen and braai/BBQ, and of course I love
          spending time with my amazing little family. I have a beautiful wife Astrid (who is also a
          creative) and beautiful 5 year old daughter Isla, who just started school, as well as the
          cutest 3 year old boy you have ever seen, Cole ❤️
          <br />
          <br />
          And that’s me in a nutshell. Thanks for stopping by! Cheers 👋🏻
